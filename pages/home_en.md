# Panod.io

> tl;dr: It's time for Panod.io, an audio only interface to the acoustic web.


## Management Summary

Panod.io is going to be an Android application, running on all sorts of smartphones and tablets,
providing an audio only interface for humans to access data from the acoustic web.

The first data source is going to be Panoptikum.io, a database with 1.800.000+ episodes from
30.000+ podcasts.

Being an audio interface, it empowers humans, who were not able to use webbrowser, smartphones
or tablets to access the huge amount of audio content available on the World wide web.
