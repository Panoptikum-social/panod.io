# Panod.io

> tl;dr: It's time for Panod.io, an audio only interface to the acoustic web.


## Management Summary

Panod.io is going to be an Android application, running on all sorts of smartphones and tablets,
providing an audio only interface for humans to access data from the acoustic web.

The first data source is going to be Panoptikum.io, a database with 1.800.000+ episodes from
30.000+ podcasts.

Being an audio interface, it empowers humans, who were not able to use webbrowser, smartphones
or tablets to access the huge amount of audio content available on the World wide web.

## Current State

Currently, with [Panoptikum.io](https://panoptikum.io) we own a data source of more than 1.800.00 million episodes from more than 30.000 podcasts, of the most diverse topics, quality, length and languages. People recommend and like podcasts, episodes and chapters. Within all the metadata, that also includes the show notes, one can search with arbitrary search terms using a proper search engine.

To get access, it is still necessary to operate a web browser, for further subscription using a podcatcher application on a smartphone is recommended.

These two aspects are not satisfactory, by any means, because they exclude relevant groups of our society from participating and benefitting. We are all excluded in certain situations, e.g., if we don't have our hands free, no matter, if we are driving a car, jogging, fix our bike with dirty hands or are engaged in the kitchen.

## Our plan

Our plan is to create an audio interface to the acoustic web, that is the audio files on the internet. Further on, we will make all contents, that are available in text form, via TTS (text to speech) available.

We had started with an elaborate project plan - originally designed for an application for project support. This plan is available for you at [Plan/EN](/plan_en), if you are interested in the details.

## Our vision

*Either we as a society take controll of education, or trends, fake news and shit storms on Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp or their successors will become the main influencers. We can change that.*

In current educationsal settings one teachers has to take care for 15 pupils at least, often for more
than 30. So lots of questions stay unanswered, social media take over more and more roles in training and
education.

Our Vision has got a name - Indigo. Indigo is a possible instance of a learning assistant, that still has
to be createy collaboratively. Indigo shall be available at any time for everybody and support people
in training and education in the sense of an idael mentor.

Indigo will be created as a collaborative work of many people, their algorithms and data are open source
 and open data. Scientists from many fields and areas will contribute to her creations, accompany her development of the years und research the first development of a strong artificial intelligence monitoring her.

 Many aspects have to be taken into consideration her, an incomplete list could contain:

 * technical feasability
 * privacy
 * freedom of opinion
 * didactics
 * philosophy
 * ethics
 * acceptance in the society
 * trust
 * upbringing
 * scientific facts, theories and models
 * training and education

 Aim of laying out this vision is to encourage thinking about the future of education and finding people
 and organisations, who are interested in and want to collaborate on the creation of Indigo.

 Panod.io will become Indigo, eventually.
