# Our Plan

## 1 Project Characteristics

### 1.1 Relevance for the Internet

* potential user groups, who have been denied from the WWW up to now, get barrier free access to the
  acountstic web, a.k.a. podcasts
* Panod.io uses data of the already existing platform Panoptikum https://panoptikum.io, that is
  developed, maintained and hosted in Austria by the project team.
* Further linking of local acting podcasters to international audiences


### 1.2 How is the Product Made Available to the Public?

* Download an Android application with audio interface for tabletts and smartphones from the website
  of the project as well as free app stores like F-Droid and from the Google App Store
* Audio interface removes barriers for physically challenged and visually impaired internet users.
* Stores a minimal amount of data to provide access
* Psoudonymity (User are encouraged to make wrong statements on their names, or create several accounts
  to preserve their anonymity)
* No connection or correlation to accounts on the major commercial platforms.


### 1.3 This is how the Project Reaches as many Users as Possible

* Talks at conferences, planned: A-Tag'18, Subscribe(s), 35C3, Re:Publica, Podcasting Meetup,
  Privacy Week, other meetups in the meetup scene Vienna: Project Night, Webclerks, Android Heads
  Meetup Vienna, ...
* Distribution via the podcasting community, that is the podcasters who are panoptikum users
* Making use of the existing platform and community of Panoptikum.io
* Projekt home page
* Österreichischer Blindenverband, Hilfsgemeinschaft der Blinden und Sehschwachen Ö.s, libraries for the
  blind in Austria and Germany

## 2 Project Description

### 2.1 Project Goals

* Android application with audio only interface
* Access to more than 1.800.000 podcast episodes from the database via the Panoptikum API
* No manual action for using the application necessary
* barrier free project web site to download the application, Descriptions in text and audio format
* Availability in three app stores at least
* Project documentation in German and English

### 2.2 State of the Art Technology & Methond


* Speech to Text (User has to be able to speak and talk as the only prerequisites)
* Natural Language Processing to recognize the intent
* Search for desired content within Panoptikum and verbal presentation of the search results
* Playback or appending to play list

### 2.3 Solutions and Suggestions

* Android Speech-to-Text API
* Speech recognition - Natural Language Processing
* Android application (wide adoption of devices, high availability for reasonably priced devices)
* Requests to the data base of Panoptikum via web requests (API)
* smartphones (small, head phone usage, small loud speakers, usage off the power grid)
* tabletts (bigger, better sounding load speakers, usage off the power grid)

### 2.4 Risks

* Quality of speech to text recognition in German
* Quality of the data model
* User interface needs to be intuitive
* Availability of users with diverse demands for acceptance testing
* Support of older Android phones, to be able to use as many smart phones as possible at hand

## 3 Pestel Analysis and Applications

### 3.1 Current Activities in the Project Area

Development and operations of  Panoptikum.io:

* Podcast directory, search engine and social network: https://panoptikum.io/
* Meta informationen about the project: https://blog.panoptikum.io/
* Proof for continous development with more than 50 blog posts accompaning development: https://blog.panoptikum.io/blog/

### 3.2 Unique Selling Proposition in Comparison with Existing Solutions of Other Vendors

* Initial touch anywhere on the screen starts speech interface (privacy concerns against continous
  monitoring)
* No visus (ability to see) necessary
* No proprietary hardware necessary, compatibility to a huge amount of Android driven smart phones
  and tablets
* all software written (including the Panoptikum directory) is open source and free software

### 3.3 Target groups

We pick here only the biggest group of visually impaired, the application is usable for all people
that are able to hear and speak:

* visually impaired in Austria \~ 318.000
* visually impaired in Germany \~ 1.800.000
* visually impaired world wide \~ 285.000.000

### 3.4 Advantages for Users

* After the initial installation, no visual user interfaces have to be used, speech input suffices
* There is no need to learn a new skill for non technical people. Speech is a well known medium.
* No propriatary hardware is necessary (as it would be in contrast e.g. for an Amazon Alexa Skill)
* No accounts at the major platforms, that resell or reuse data commercially, are necessary
  (Facebook, Google, Amazon)

### 3.5 Sustainability

* Software will be AGPL 3 licensed, i.e. freely extendable, adaptable and updateable
* AGPL garantees, that there will be no restrictions on later licensing conditions or prerequisits.
* no restrictions by patents,
* Finanzing of platform operations and updates via
  * donations
  * pro accounts for podcasters using the Panoptikum backend
* Cooperations with content distributors and broadcasting corporations.

Extensions after 2018 extending the area of podcasts:

* Internet radio streams (real time information, there are several thousand streams available)
* Audio content, that is not distributed via feeds, such as spoken Wikipedia
* Content from media centers, e.g. provided for the public by public broadcasting corporations
* Content from web pages, that already offer reading aloud services, that are only accessible
  via web browsers up to now.
* Integration of content, that is currently distributed via Daisy(\~MP3)-CDs by libraries for
  visually impaired
* Audio communication between users (voice chat)

combined: Access to all parts of the acoustic web

### 3.6 Intellectual Property

All artifacts will be licensed under the AGPL3 license:

* Application source code on Github:https://github.com/PanoptikumIO/panodio: AGPL3
* Application compiled via the web site and in several app stores for download: AGPL3

* Applikation im Quellcode auf Github:
* Applikation kompiliert auf der Webseite und in div. App-Stores zum Download: AGPL3

dual licensed also via  GPL FDL & CC4.0:

* Documentation for developers in the Github wiki: https://github.com/PanoptikumIO/panodio/wiki:
* Documentation for users on the web site (https://panod.io)

### 3.7 Opportunites for Cooperations with Interesting Scientific or Economic Aspects?

* Libraries (for visually impaired)
* Broadcasting corporations
* Universities and universities of applied sciences (speech recognition, ux design)
* Municipalities that provide acoustic services already, e.g. City of Vienna
* Producers of aids to the blind (e.g. in Austria: Baum Retec GmbH)
* Podcast platforms: Google (Podcast Store, currently only in the US), Apple, Amazon, ...

### 3.8 Gibt es positive regionalpolitische Aspekte?

Kommunen und andere Institutionen mit Vorleseservices (z.B. Gemeinde Wien) könnten Inhalte damit
nicht nur per Webbrowser publizieren, sondern Inhalte wären auch per Sprachnavigation verfügbar.

### 3.9 Ergeben sich beachtenswerte soziale, gesellschaftliche bzw. Umwelt-Aspekte

* Weiterbildung (über 1000 wissenschaftliche Podcasts) führt zu besserer Employability
* größerer Fokus geht auf das akustische Web, das bislang wenig Beachtung findet (Spoken Wikipedia
  ist weitgehend unbekannt)
* Bislang nicht im Netz aktive Personen sind nicht mehr vom Internet ausgeschlossen

### 3.10 Welche besondere Relevanz hat unser Projekt für das Thema "Closing the gender gap"?

* Sprachinterface bringt niedrigere technische Einstiegsschwelle
* bessere Tauglichkeit für ältere, sehbehinderte, bislang nicht im Internet agierende Nutzerinnen
* Einstieg in die Welt der Podcasts ohne technisches Vorverständnis möglich
* keine Einschulung nötig, das Device spricht mit den Benutzerinnen

### 3.11 Welche besondere Relevanz hat unser Projekt für das Thema "Privacy by Design"?

* Entwicklung nach den Prinzipien der Datensparsamkeit
* Daten werden nur gespeichert, wenn nötig, soweit möglich nur am Device und nicht im Web-Backend
* Im Web-backend besteht keine Klarnamenpflicht
